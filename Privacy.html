<h2>Formal Definition of Privacy on a Website:</h2>
<p> 
Privacy on a website refers to the protection of personal information that is collected, used,
disclosed, and stored by a website or its third-party service providers. This personal
information includes any data that can identify an individual, such as name, address, email,
phone number, and financial information. Protecting privacy on a website involves
compliance with data protection laws and regulations, as well as the implementation of
technical and organizational measures to ensure that personal information is kept
confidential, secure, and used only for lawful purposes.</p>

<p>Reasons for Ensuring Websites are Built with Privacy in Mind
Many countries have laws and regulations governing the collection, use, and disclosure of
personal information. Non-compliance with these laws can result in severe penalties,
including fines and reputational damage.</p>

<p>Website visitors expect their personal information to be treated with respect and kept
confidential. Failure to protect personal information can lead to a loss of trust in the website
    and its owners.</p>

<p>Privacy breaches and data leaks can damage a company&#39;s reputation, leading to a loss of
customers, revenue, and market share.</p>
