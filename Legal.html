                <h2>What dose legal mean?</h2>
                <img src="images_2025/SurferSilhouette_Extension.png" alt="Website Logo" class="logo">

<p>   In simple terms legal means relating to the law or permitted by law. Doing something legal means that the government of your country has decided that the thing you want to do is legal, for example doing 100 kilometers an hour on a highway that has been labelled as a 100 kilometre zone. For an example involving a website you must check that none of the information that is on your website is plagiarised or directly copied from another website. If you were to directly copy information the original website may be able to take legal action to remove that information.

<h2>How to make sure that your Website is Legal</h2>
    <img src="images_2025/SurferSilhouette_Extension.png" alt="Website Logo" class="logo">             
<p> 
    When checking that your website is legal there  are some main factors to consider. You must make sure you tell the person interacting with the website that you will be collecting data and what data you will be collecting. You must also include how, where and when the information is being collected.Once the information is collected it cannot be sold to anyone under any circumstances. You must also protect your clients information. You could do this using these methods. Firewalls, physical access controls, and information access authorization controls to protect your data. All of these can be used together or one at a time to protect your clients info. Accessibility requirements is a main point but I will discuss that in the social tab as it is relevant to this information. It may seem obvious but you must not take information from another website as this will be flagged as plagiarism.</p>


<h2>Examples of Ilegal websites</h2>

               <P>Quill bot:Quill bot could be considered illegal because of the fact it rewrites everything as plagiarism free text. It can also rewrite AI generated text so that when the Ai scanners are checking the text they will not be able to tell that the text was written by AI Which is Illegal.
                                                            </P>

                    <p>123Movies: 123Movies is illegal because it is a piracy website. It steals the movies from other websites and shows them for free. This is illegal because they are streaming these movies and shows for free with no right to the movies. This makes the website illegal.
                                                            </p>

                    Wikipedia: Wikipedia is legal because it has its own information and dosent plageries abnd if they do take in formation the reference the source and don't just take. There information is legitimate and factual un less the page requires propaganda. Wikipedia is a trusted page. Years ago theyb used to have problem with changing information but that has been fixed now so all the information is legitimate.
