          <h2> Relevant Implications: </h2>

<p>
When building a website, it&#39;s important to consider the relevant implications that can
impact the site&#39;s success. These implications include the target audience, purpose of the
website, and website performance. Understanding the target audience helps in designing a
website that resonates with them and meets their needs. The purpose of the website
dictates the design, functionality, and content needed to achieve its goals. Optimising
website performance is also crucial for ensuring that visitors have a positive experience and
are more likely to engage with the site.</p>
<p>
Being aware of these relevant implications can help designers create a website that is user-
friendly, meets the needs of the target audience, and achieves its purpose. Designing a
website without considering these implications can result in a site that doesn&#39;t resonate
with visitors or meet their needs. Additionally, a poorly optimised site can lead to high
bounce rates and low engagement, affecting the site&#39;s success.</p>
<h2>Usability Heuristics:</h2>
            <img src="images_2025/SurferSilhouette_Extension.png" alt="Website Logo" class="logo">    
<p>
Usability heuristics are guidelines that can improve the overall usability of a website. These
guidelines are based on user research and best practices and can improve the user
experience. Being aware of these heuristics is crucial when designing a website to ensure
that it&#39;s user-friendly and easy to use. Some of the common usability heuristics include
visibility of system status, consistency, and error prevention.</p>
<p>
Following these usability heuristics can result in a website that is easy to use, intuitive, and
improves the user experience. Being aware of these heuristics can help designers identify
potential usability issues and improve the website&#39;s design accordingly. Failing to follow
these heuristics can lead to a site that is difficult to use, frustrating, and negatively impacts
the user experience.</p>
<h2>Design Elements:</h2>
                <img src="images_2025/SurferSilhouette_Extension.png" alt="Website Logo" class="logo">
<p>
Design elements are critical components of a website that can greatly impact the user
experience. These elements include typography, colour schemes, layout, images, icons,
buttons, and other interactive elements such as forms, menus, and animations. Being aware
of these design elements is important when building a website because they can greatly
impact the user experience and determine whether visitors stay on the site or leave
immediately.</p>
<p>
Designing a website with these design elements in mind can result in a visually appealing,
easy to navigate, and intuitive site. Being aware of the design elements can help designers
make informed decisions about the site&#39;s design and functionality, resulting in a more
effective website. Additionally, being aware of these design elements can help designers
identify potential issues and improve the site&#39;s design accordingly. Failing to consider these
design elements can lead to a site that is difficult to use, unappealing, and negatively
impacts the user experience.</p>
