What does social mean you may ask? Social in website terms is all about the way that people interact with your website. I would say that it links in to usability as it means you must consider the needs and beliefs of the users of the website that you will be creating. You must ensure that you have not offended, misrepresented, stigmatised or stereotyped any certain group of people that may or may not visit your website. Basically you should use your basic manners so as to not offend anyone. Rather than offending a group you should attempt to appeal to the group of people your website is for.

<h2>Formal Definition of Socail Acceptabilty on a Website:</h2>
                
                <p> Website relevant social implications" refers to the potential social impacts a website can have on its users and the wider community, including factors like accessibility, inclusivity, privacy concerns, the spread of misinformation, cyberbullying, and the ability to connect and mobilize people around certain causes depending on the website's content and design. 
                </p>

    <h2>Things to think about when esure that you don't misrepresent anyone when making your website.</h2>
  
                <p>You should check the information you are putting on your website id factual and not just someone's opinion. The information must also be accurate or atleast based of truth. If you collect accurate and factual information you will most likely not misrepresent anyone.
                </p>

                <h2> Does your Website offend anyone</h2>

                <p>To be confident that your website will not offend people there are some things you can do.One thing you can do is be very careful about the content that is on your website. For example you would not put a racist symbol on your website as that will most likely offend the users of your website. Essentially don't put any content or don't allow any content on your website that could potentially offend someone.
                </p>

                <h2>Will your Website contribute to a stereotype?</h2>
                                
                <p>When you build your website be sure not to just add information as it may stereotype a group of people. Don't say something about a group of people because this may come across as a hurtful stereotype. In simple words don't lump people together and say something about that group as a whole. Treat everyone as individuals that visit your website.
